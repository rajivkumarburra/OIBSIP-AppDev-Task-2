# AppDev-Task-2-Calculator

A calculator made using the Flutter framework for android phones.

## About

This project is my second submission towards my internship with Oasis Infobyte.

It is a simple calculator app made using the Flutter framework. It is a basic calculator with the following functions:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a clean and intuitive interface that resembles a real calculator, complete with a vibrant display and responsive buttons. The layout is thoughtfully organized, allowing users to effortlessly input and manipulate numbers and operators.
